# About the project

PassGet is a password manager that is used to solve a modern problem, where creating a good password and remembering it could be a daunting task, especially if you want to use multiple passwords for different accounts for maximum security. 
In the internet, users need accounts to access parts of the Internet, such as social media sites, forums, games, and many more, which makes having a strong password an essential criteria in the internet to make your accounts secure.


### PassGet aims to help with password generation, password saving and testing.


PassGet consists of four different pages, the main page where users are introduced to the functionalities of the website, the password generator which generates random passwords according to user settings, password library which stores saved passwords and lastly the password strength checker which checks the strength of the password through a number of different criterias. 


The password generator generates a random password with a simple click of the generate button, and settings can be set by the user to change how the password is generated. The password that has already been generated can be saved and will be stored in the password library if the user decides to do so.


The password library is a webpage that contain your saved passwords with a maximum of 10 stored passwords. The user can also create new password or quick generate a password from within this page, as well as copy, edit, and delete the passwords that are stored.
  
  
Ultimately, the password strength checker takes a password as an input and will decide whether that password is weak or medium or strong through a number of different criterias, such as the password length and the use of symbols and numbers.
